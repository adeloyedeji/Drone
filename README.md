=====
Network Performance Prediction System is a full Java based system for analysing the state of communication networks using a series of algorithm i.e. MCMC(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithm to generate the probability sequesnces and other algorithms also. 
Please Note, This Project have some major dependencies which must be installed for it to work Properly
1. MySQL relational database management system to store values and states
2. Netica-J api which can be found at http://www.norsys.com/netica-j.html
3. Hydra Java Library to implement the Random Walk Algorithm for Markov Chain Monte Carlo
4. and some othr libraries that are included in the project.
